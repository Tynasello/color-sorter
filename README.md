# color-sorter

The purpose of this project was to create a system that would sort objects based on color. I chose skittles as the objects to be sorted. Two micro servo motors were used in the project; one to pick up the skittles and one to drop them into designated cups. A TCS230 color sensor was used to read the color. Red, green, and yellow skittles were sorted and dropped into corresponding cups.
